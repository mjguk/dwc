<div class="wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-1134"><div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow">All my recipes on here are my favourites. I love to try new things on the BBQ and also in the slow cooker. Food doesn’t have to be boring and making a few simple changes to a couple of ingredients can transform a dish. Dadwhatcooks.com comes from my love of food and being a dad of course.

I’m not a professional chef, I’m actually an IT guy. But I’m a dad what cooks, hence dadwhatcooks (bad grammar I know but hey) and I love a BBQ. I have some [good BBQ friends](http://www.instagram.com/chopperhontas) too whom I share recipes with but why not share with the world. Welcome to my site.

</div><div class="wp-block-column is-layout-flow"><figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized">![dad what cooks dadwhatcooks.com](https://www.dadwhatcooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/me.jpg)</figure>I was always a charcoal BBQ snob and failed to embrace a good gas grill. I felt cooking on gas was a cheats way of doing a BBQ and never wanted to try. Until I caved in and got a gas grill. I opted for a Weber Genesis 2 and haven’t looked back.

[This is a site of my favourite recipes](https://www.dadwhatcooks.com/blog/) I’ve found and either want to try or am going to try. I hope you can try them too and share your success with me.

I thought, why not combine the two and learn on the way….
