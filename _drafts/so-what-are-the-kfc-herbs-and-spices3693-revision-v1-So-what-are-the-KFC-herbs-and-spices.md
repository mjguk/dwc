## We all have heard about the 11 herbs and spices in the KFC chicken recipe, but exactly what are the KFC herbs and spices used? 

Is this fact, or fiction? Who knows… but I do know that the recipe I’ve put together tastes a lot like the real deal. So let me put an initial disclaimer at the top of this post – this is not the recipe. It is a recipe which I think tastes like it and is the closest one I’ve made yet.

As part of the trial and error, [I made some halloumi fries which are coated in the KFC style herbs and spices.](https://www.dadwhatcooks.com/ultimate-kfc-style-halloumi-fries/) I recommend you try that some time as well as chicken.

In my mix, I use the following:

- 1 tsp Table salt
- ¾ tsp Dried Thyme
- ¾ tsp Dried Basil
- 2 tbsp Paprika
- ½ tsp Dried Oregano
- ½ tbsp Celery salt
- 1 tbsp Garlic salt
- ½ tbsp Black pepper
- ½ tbsp Dry mustard powder
- ½ tbsp Ground Ginger
- 1 Cup [Plain white flour](https://amzn.to/3ikoxSN)

All these combined and stored in an air tight container will last for a while. It will give you enough to coat a full chicken, but if you want to try is as you buy it in the shop you’ll need to separate the chicken into logs, breast and wings.

### Recipes to try

Check out my [halloumi fries recipe](https://www.dadwhatcooks.com/ultimate-kfc-style-halloumi-fries/) to try this coating on.

Try the herbs and spices on anything. If you can fry it, you can add the KFC herbs and spices on it. I quite like to add it to chicken pieces and pop them in the air fryer. These take about 12 minutes to cook, but are well worth the effort.

If you are looking for the ultimate KFC experience, you need to try using a real deep fat fryer and cooking the chicken in the KFC herbs and spices coating for a few minutes before serving. Not quite as healthy as the air fryer, but a bit more like the real thing.
