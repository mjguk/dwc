So there are a few sizes to pick from when it comes to the Instant Pot. My only advice is to go for the biggest one that is in your budget. You will regret one that is too small, but the bigger ones can work when not filled to the brim also, so go as big as you can.

Iâ€™ve moved myself away from the Instant Pot these days and have migrated to a Ninja Foodi. This offers all the same perks as the standard Instant Pot, but with the ability to Air Fry also. Certainly worth giving them a look see.
