- 6 to 8 medium potatoes (red-skinned, Yukon Gold, fingerlings, etc.)
- 3 medium carrots
- 2 to 3 ribs celery
- 4 pounds corned beef brisket (preferably flat cut)
- 1 (2-pound) head of cabbage
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper
- 1 1/2 cups water

#### Method

1. Gather the ingredients.
2. Peel the potatoes and cut them into 1/2-inch slices.
3. Peel the carrots and slice them into 1/4-inch rounds.
4. Slice the celery.
5. Lightly butter a 5- to 6-quart slow cooker, or spray it with nonstick cooking spray.
6. Layer the potato slices over the bottom of the pot with carrots and celery.
7. Place corned beef on vegetables. If it doesn’t fit comfortably in your slow cooker, cut it into 2 or 3 pieces.
8. Slice the cabbage into 8 wedges.
9. Arrange the wedges around the meat and add the pepper and water. Alternatively, if the slow cooker is not large enough, boil the cabbage wedges on the stovetop in a small amount of lightly salted water about 10 to 15 minutes before the corned beef is ready.
10. Cover and cook on high for 1 hour.
11. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook on the low setting for 6 to 8 hours, or until the corned beef and vegetables are tender.
12. Remove the meat to a platter, cover with foil, and let it rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.
13. Slice and serve!

## Money saver Version

This recipe can be reproduced without the specific ingredients. Vegetables can be swapped out for whatever you have available. The cut of meat can certainly be a tougher cheaper cut due to the length of time it will be cooked for.

I certainly recommend choosing a slow cooker for this recipe as it is a good investment to produce large meals.
