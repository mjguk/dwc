#### Ingredients

Eggs

Foil

Fry light cooking spray or oil

#### Method

Make a dish out of foil by forming it over another bowl or small dish.

Spray the formed foil with fry light and then crack the egg in to it. For ease of getting the egg out you could put some greaseproof paper down too.

Pop the eggs in the oven at 200 degrees (or 180 if you have a fan oven) for just 8 minutes.

Hey presto, quick oven eggs!
