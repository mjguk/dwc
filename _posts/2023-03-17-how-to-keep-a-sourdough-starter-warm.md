Living in the UK and using a sourdough starter from San Francisco gives me problems from time to time. The main issue I face is that of our climate here in England is not consistent and I often battle with how to regulate the temperature of my sourdough starter and keep my sourdough starter warm.

I had the thought to look at how I could keep a steady temperature and this is my journey on battling with the challenges so far…

### What is the ideal temperature for a sourdough starter to thrive?

They say that room temperature is the best temperature for your sourdough starter. But guess what, all rooms are different. In my opinion however, I have found that my[ San Francisco sourdough starter](https://www.dadwhatcooks.com/150-year-old-san-francisco-sourdough-starter-review/) seems happiest at around 22C (71.5F). During our recent 20223/2023 winter however, our room has been dropping to 12C over night (which to put in context is probably only about 7C more than the refrigerator in the kitchen. So with that in mind I needed a way to warm up the room, or if not the room, keep the sourdough starter warm.

## Sourdough Starter Feeding Ratio

### How often do I feed my sourdough starter? 

#### Left on the counter

This question is decided on how much bread I’m going to be making. If I bake every day, the the starter should remain out of the fridge and fed on a daily basis. My feed consists of a 1-1-1 ratio of flour, water, original starter. I still need to keep the sourdough starter warm, but at least I’m not needing to warm it up from refrigerated temperatures. My go to ratios are:

- 1/2 cup flour
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/2 cup of orignal starter

So when discarding my starter from the day before, what is left should be the same as the amount of [water ](#starter-water)and flour going in a fresh. As noted above, I leave 1/2 cup of starter and then add in a 1/2 cup flour and 1/2 cup water.

#### Keeping sourdough starter in the fridge

I chop and change my routines depending on how much I am in the mood for baking bread. Some times I get lazy and forget to bake sourdough for ages, so when I’m feeling like that I make sure to put my starter in the fridge straight after a feed. Doing this really slows down the bacteria’s in there as the sourdough starter warm environment is removed (for more scientific explanations, [see this post](https://www.seriouseats.com/sourdough-starter-science#:~:text=In%20the%20world%20of%20sourdough,yeasts%20and%20lactic%20acid%20bacteria.) – I’m not going into it considering there is loads of info on the internet about it!!). What I do know is that when kept in the fridge, I only need to feed her once a week.

The feeding pattern is the same, 1-1-1 as per above.

### What water should I use to feed my starter?

This is something I am quite particular with. The reason being is that I think depending where you are in the UK, the water can change drastically. Up north its nice and soft, but down south it is quite hard and limescale prominent.

With this in mind, I’m a firm believer in using cool boiled water or filter water. For cool boiled water, boil some up in the kettle and then leave it to cool for an hour or so until you get warm but not hot water. That’s perfect to get your sourdough starter warm and begin working with the flour. Filtered water works ok too, but I find this is generally better for longer, slower proves (24 to 48 hour fridge proves). I have a [water filter machine which provides this water for me](https://amzn.to/3Jm1alf), but a [Britta ](https://amzn.to/3JMOUeJ)type will do the same job.

Of course, tap water will still work. After all, people have been making bread for thousands of years and managed without any of these fancy gadgets!

## Keeping sourdough starter warm

Back to the original point of this post. Having done a bit of home brew beer making in the past, I know that constant temperatures are a key part to a successful brew. Sourdough starters are not any different. To get the starter nice and active, it needs to be warm enough to get the party started in the jar. Let me [introduce the Hops Brew heat pad – home brew heat mat](https://amzn.to/3lg1UAp). This was my thought to get the starter in a nice warm environment without needing to keep the house heating on all the time.

<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-large is-resized">[![How to keep a sourdough starter warm using a heat mat](https://www.dadwhatcooks.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/5C418430-0302-4732-B756-AE147A8507E5-628x628.jpeg)](https://amzn.to/3lg1UAp)<figcaption class="wp-element-caption">HopsBrew Heat Pad – [Buy from Amazon here](https://amzn.to/3lg1UAp)</figcaption></figure>This heat pad has a temperature control and thermometer belt which allows you to get a constant temperature to your sourdough starter container.

I have found that it is best to keep your sourdough starter warm to a temperature set at around 20C on the pad, any higher and it can dry it out (or even bake it to the bottom of the jar!). This will take some experimenting and getting used to, but a good place to start is 18C on the thermostat with the thermometer attached to the jar.
