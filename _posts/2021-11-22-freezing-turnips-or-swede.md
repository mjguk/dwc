Let me show you how freezing turnip or swede successfully is possible but it takes a quick bit of prep first.

So it’s a simple little tip, but saves time when doing food preparation. Once you have diced your desired root vegetables, use the fresh ones for the meal you are making and anything left over in the pack can be saved. But rather than just putting them back in the fridge to go off later, it is possible to freeze them.

Freezing turnips is not only a great band name, but also possible and then use them later in one of the instant pot recipes or [slow cooker recipes](https://www.dadwhatcooks.com/category/slow-cooker-recipes/) we have to offer.

So there are a few sizes to pick from when it comes to the Instant Pot. My only advice is to go for the biggest one that is in your budget. You will regret one that is too small, but the bigger ones can work when not filled to the brim also, so go as big as you can.

I’ve moved myself away from the Instant Pot these days and have migrated to a Ninja Foodi. This offers all the same perks as the standard Instant Pot, but with the ability to Air Fry also. Certainly worth giving them a look see.

This is simply a case of boiling a pan of water with a pinch of salt in it. Then drop in the chopped swede or turnip and leave it in there for two minutes.   
  
Once the two minutes is up, drain and let them cool. Then bag them up and pop them in the freezer. They’ll be good to take out as and when you next need them. Then once defrosted, cook them as though you would if they were freshly chopped.
